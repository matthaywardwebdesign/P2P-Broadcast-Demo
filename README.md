### P2P Broadcast Demo
This repo is a demo of a P2P based video broadcast.
The code is terrible so don't use it anywhere, but it does work.

**How to use**

[Demo here](http://matthaywardwebdesign.github.io/P2P-Broadcast-Demo)

Simply load the `index.html` file in your browser (Only tested in Chrome, but should work in Firefox) and start broadcasting.
Note: You have to wait 15 seconds for the stream ID to load after you start broadcasting so be patient :)

To view the stream simply open the `viewer.html` in any WebRTC supporting browser anywhere in the world and enter the stream ID, wait a little bit and you should have a video on the screen.
